# 1.1.1.2 vFAT: filesystem
  - id: 6150 
    title: "Ensure mounting of FAT filesystems is limited"
    description: "The VFAT filesystem format is primarily used on older windows systems and portable USB drives or flash modules. It comes in three types FAT12 , FAT16 , and FAT32 all of which are supported by the vfat kernel module."
    rationale: "Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it."
    remediation: "Edit or create a file in the /etc/modprobe.d/ directory ending in .conf . Example: vim /etc/modprobe.d/vfat.conf: install vfat /bin/true. Run the following command to unload the vfat module: # rmmod vfat"

    description: "The /var directory is used by daemons and other system services to temporarily store dynamic data. Some directories created by these processes may be world-writable."
    rationale: "Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition."

    rationale: "Since the /var/tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /var/tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /var/tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code."

# 1.7.1.5 Ensure no unconfined services exist (Scored)
  - id: 6160 
    title: "Ensure no unconfined services exist"
    description: "Unconfined processes run in unconfined domains"
    rationale: "For unconfined processes, SELinux policy rules are applied, but policy rules exist that allow processes running in unconfined domains almost all access. Processes running in unconfined domains fall back to using DAC rules exclusively. If an unconfined process is compromised, SELinux does not prevent an attacker from gaining access to system resources and data, but of course, DAC rules are still used. SELinux is a security enhancement on top of DAC rules – it does not replace them"
    remediation: "Investigate any unconfined processes found during the audit action. They may need to have an existing security context assigned to them or a policy built for them. Notes: Occasionally certain daemons such as backup or centralized management software may require running unconfined. Any such software should be carefully analyzed and documented before such an exception is made."

    description: "The system-wide crypto-policies followed by the crypto core components allow consistently deprecating and disabling algorithms system-wide. The individual policy levels (DEFAULT, LEGACY, FUTURE, and FIPS) are included in the crypto-policies(7) package."
    rationale: "If the Legacy system-wide crypto policy is selected, it includes support for TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, and SSH2 protocols or later. The algorithms DSA, 3DES, and RC4 are allowed, while RSA and Diffie-Hellman parameters are accepted if larger than 1023-bits. These legacy protocols and algorithms can make the system vulnerable to attacks, including those listed in RFC 7457 FUTURE: Is a conservative security level that is believed to withstand any near-term future attacks. This level does not allow the use of SHA-1 in signature algorithms. The RSA and Diffie-Hellman parameters are accepted if larger than 3071 bits. The level provides at least 128-bit security FIPS: Conforms to the FIPS 140-2 requirements.

    rationale: "It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open , creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document."
