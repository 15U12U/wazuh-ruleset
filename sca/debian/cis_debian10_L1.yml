# 1.1.x Filesystem Configuration
  - id: 3005
    title: "Ensure /tmp is configured"
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."
    remediation: "Configure /etc/fstab as appropriate. Example: tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0 or Run the following commands to enable systemd /tmp mounting: systemctl unmask tmp.mount systemctl enable tmp.mount Edit /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount to configure the /tmp mount"

    description: "sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy. The invoking user's real (not effective) user ID is used to determine the user name with which to query the security policy."
    rationale: "sudo supports a plugin architecture for security policies and input/output logging. Third parties can develop and distribute their own policy and I/O logging plugins to work seamlessly with the sudo front end. The default security policy is sudoers, which is configured via the file /etc/sudoers. The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has to run sudo. The policy may require that users authenticate themselves with a password or another authentication mechanism. If authentication is required, sudo will exit if the user's password is not entered within a configurable time limit. This limit is policy-specific."

    description: "The grub configuration file contains information on boot settings and passwords for unlocking boot options. The grub configuration is usually grub.cfg stored in /boot/grub."
    rationale: "Setting the permissions to read and write for root only prevents non-root users from seeing the boot parameters or changing them. Non-root users who read the boot parameters may be able to identify weaknesses in security upon boot and be able to exploit them."

# 1.5 Additional Process Hardening
  - id: 3022
    title: "Ensure core dumps are restricted"
    description: "A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally used to determine why a program aborted. It can also be used to glean confidential information from a core file. The system provides the ability to set a soft limit for core dumps, but this can be overridden by the user."
    rationale: "Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the soft variable. If core dumps are required, consider setting limits for user groups (see limits.conf(5) ). In addition, setting the fs.suid_dumpable variable to 0 will prevent setuid programs from dumping core."

    title: "Ensure XD/NX support is enabled"
    description: "Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute (NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on 32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature."

    remediation: "On 32 bit systems install a kernel with PAE support, no installation is required on 64 bit systems: If necessary configure your bootloader to load the new kernel and reboot the system. You may need to enable NX or XD support in your bios."

In contrast to NTP implementations such as chrony or the NTP reference server this only implements a client side, and does not bother with the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying time from one remote server and synchronizing the local clock to it. The daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup, in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi and embedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it is not always correct. To make use of this daemon a new system user and group \"systemd- timesync\" needs to be created on installation of systemd. Note: The systemd-timesyncd service specifically implements only SNTP. This minimalistic service will set the system clock for large offsets or slowly adjust it for smaller deltas. More complex use cases are not covered by systemd-timesyncd.

    title: "Ensure remote rsyslog messages are only accepted on designated log hosts"
    description: "By default, rsyslog does not listen for log messages coming in from remote systems. The ModLoad tells rsyslog to load the imtcp.so module so it can listen over a network via TCP. The InputTCPServerRun option instructs rsyslogd to listen on the specified TCP port."
    rationale: "The guidance in the section ensures that remote log hosts are configured to only accept rsyslog data from hosts within the specified domain and that those systems that are not designed to be log hosts do not accept any remote rsyslog messages. This provides protection from spoofed log data and ensures that system administrators are reviewing reasonably complete syslog data in a central location."
    remediation: "For hosts that are designated as log hosts, edit the /etc/rsyslog.conf file and un-comment or add the following lines:$ModLoad imtcp & $InputTCPServerRun 514. For hosts that are not designated as log hosts, edit the /etc/rsyslog.conf file and comment or remove the following lines: # $ModLoad imtcp # $InputTCPServerRun 514. Run the following command to reload the rsyslogd configuration: # pkill -HUP rsyslogd"

    title: "Ensure journald is configured to send logs to rsyslog"
    description: "Data from journald may be stored in volatile memory or persisted locally on the server. Utilities exist to accept remote export of journald logs, however, use of the rsyslog service provides a consistent means of log collection and export."
    rationale: "Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks. If an attacker gains root access on the local system, they could tamper with or remove log data that is stored on the local system."

    description: "The journald system includes the capability of compressing overly large files to avoid filling up the system with logs or making the logs unmanageably large."
    rationale: "Uncompressed large files may unexpectedly fill a filesystem leading to resource unavailability. Compressing logs prior to write can prevent sudden, unexpected filesystem impacts."

    description: "Data from journald may be stored in volatile memory or persisted locally on the server. Logs in memory will be lost upon a system reboot. By persisting logs to local disk on the server they are protected from loss."
