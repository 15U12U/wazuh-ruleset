  - id: 5556 
    title: "Ensure time synchronization is in use"
    description: "System time should be synchronized between all systems in an environment. This is typically done by establishing an authoritative time server or set of servers and having all systems synchronize their clocks to them."
    rationale: "Time synchronization is important to support time sensitive security mechanisms like Kerberos and also ensures log files have consistent time records across the enterprise, which aids in forensic investigations."
    remediation: "On physical systems or virtual systems where host based time synchronization is not available install chrony: # dnf install chrony  On virtual systems where host based time synchronization is available consult your virtualization software documentation and verify that host based synchronization is in use."

    description: "The X Window System provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) where users can have multiple windows in which to run programs and various add on. The X Windows system is typically used on workstations where users login, but not on servers where users typically do not login."
    rationale: "Unless your organization specifically requires graphical login access via X Windows, remove it to reduce the potential attack surface."
    remediation: "Run the following command to remove the X Windows System packages: # dnf remove xorg-x11*"

  - id: 5578 
    title: "Ensure rsync service is not enabled"
    description: "The rsyncd service can be used to synchronize files between systems over network links."
    rationale: "The rsyncd service presents a security risk as it uses unencrypted protocols for communication."

  - id: 5560 
    title: "Ensure Avahi Server is not enabled"
    description: "Avahi is a free zeroconf implementation, including a system for multicast DNS/DNS-SD service discovery. Avahi allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts running on a local network with no specific configuration. For example, a user can plug a computer into a network and Avahi automatically finds printers to print to, files to look at and people to talk to, as well as network services running on the machine."
    rationale: "Automatic discovery of network services is not normally required for system functionality. It is recommended to disable the service to reduce the potential attack surface."
