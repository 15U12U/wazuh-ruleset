  - id: 5556 
    title: "Ensure time synchronization is in use"
    description: "System time should be synchronized between all systems in an environment. This is typically done by establishing an authoritative time server or set of servers and having all systems synchronize their clocks to them."
    rationale: "Time synchronization is important to support time sensitive security mechanisms like Kerberos and also ensures log files have consistent time records across the enterprise, which aids in forensic investigations."
    remediation: "On physical systems or virtual systems where host based time synchronization is not available install chrony: # dnf install chrony  On virtual systems where host based time synchronization is available consult your virtualization software documentation and verify that host based synchronization is in use."

    description: "The X Window System provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) where users can have multiple windows in which to run programs and various add on. The X Windows system is typically used on workstations where users login, but not on servers where users typically do not login."
    rationale: "Unless your organization specifically requires graphical login access via X Windows, remove it to reduce the potential attack surface."
    remediation: "Run the following command to remove the X Windows System packages: # dnf remove xorg-x11*"

  - id: 5578 
    title: "Ensure rsync service is not enabled"
    description: "The rsyncd service can be used to synchronize files between systems over network links."
    rationale: "The rsyncd service presents a security risk as it uses unencrypted protocols for communication."

  - id: 5560 
    title: "Ensure Avahi Server is not enabled"
    description: "Avahi is a free zeroconf implementation, including a system for multicast DNS/DNS-SD service discovery. Avahi allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts running on a local network with no specific configuration. For example, a user can plug a computer into a network and Avahi automatically finds printers to print to, files to look at and people to talk to, as well as network services running on the machine."
    rationale: "Automatic discovery of network services is not normally required for system functionality. It is recommended to disable the service to reduce the potential attack surface."

    description: "The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) server is used to listen for SNMP commands from an SNMP management system, execute the commands or collect the information and then send results back to the requesting system."
    rationale: "The SNMP server can communicate using SNMP v1, which transmits data in the clear and does not require authentication to execute commands. Unless absolutely necessary, it is recommended that the SNMP service not be used. If SNMP is required the server should be configured to disallow SNMP v1."

While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open , creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media.

    title: "Ensure kernel module loading and unloading is collected"
    description: "Monitor the loading and unloading of kernel modules. The programs insmod (install a kernel module), rmmod (remove a kernel module), and modprobe (a more sophisticated program to load and unload modules, as well as some other features) control loading and unloading of modules. The init_module (load a module) and delete_module (delete a module) system calls control loading and unloading of modules. Any execution of the loading and unloading module programs and system calls will trigger an audit record with an identifier of \"modules\"."
    rationale: "Monitoring the use of insmod , rmmod and modprobe could provide system administrators with evidence that an unauthorized user loaded or unloaded a kernel module, possibly compromising the security of the system.

When the ClientAliveInterval variable is set, ssh sessions that have no activity for the specified length of time are terminated. When the ClientAliveCountMax variable is set, sshd will send client alive messages at every ClientAliveInterval interval. When the number of consecutive client alive messages are sent with no response from the client, the ssh session is terminated. For example, if the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15 seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be terminated after 45 seconds of idle time."
    rationale: "Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening. While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on site policy.

    rationale: "Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and back-doors. SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions.

A default umask setting of 077 causes files and directories created by users to not be readable by any other user on the system.
