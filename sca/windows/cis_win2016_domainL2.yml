    title: "Disable IPv6 (Ensure TCPIP6 Parameter 'DisabledComponents' is set to '0xff (255)')"
    description: "Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a set of protocols that computers use to exchange information over the Internet and over home and business networks. IPv6 allows for many more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did. Older networking, hosts and operating systems may not support IPv6 natively. The recommended state for this setting is: DisabledComponents - 0xff (255)"
    rationale: "Since the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize IPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6 components reduces a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic on. As a result, we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not needed."
    remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to 0xff (255) (DWORD): HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\TCPIP6\\Parameters:DisabledComponents. Note: This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted. Note #2: Although Microsoft does not provide an ADMX template to configure this registry value, a custom .ADM template (Disable-IPv6-Components-KB929852.adm) is provided in the CIS Benchmark Remediation Kit to facilitate its configuration. Be aware though that simply turning off the group policy setting in the .ADM template will not \"undo\" the change once applied.

    description: "This policy setting allows you to specify the maximum amount of time that an active Remote Desktop Services session can be idle (without user input) before it is automatically disconnected. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 15 minutes or less."
    rationale: "This setting helps to prevent active Remote Desktop sessions from tying up the computer for long periods of time while not in use, preventing computing resources from being consumed by large numbers of inactive sessions. In addition, old, forgotten Remote Desktop sessions that are still active can cause password lockouts if the user's password has changed but the old session is still running. For systems that limit the number of connected users (e.g. servers in the default Administrative mode - 2 sessions only), other users' old but still active sessions can prevent another user from connecting, resulting in an effective denial of service."

    description: "The Key Management Service (KMS) is a Microsoft license activation method that entails setting up a local server to store the software licenses. The KMS server itself needs to connect to Microsoft to activate the KMS service, but subsequent on-network clients can activate Microsoft Windows OS and/or their Microsoft Office via the KMS server instead of connecting directly to Microsoft. This policy setting lets you opt-out of sending KMS client activation data to Microsoft automatically. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
    rationale: "Even though the KMS licensing method does not require KMS clients to connect to Microsoft, they still send KMS client activation state data to Microsoft automatically. Preventing this information from being sent can help reduce privacy concerns in high security environments."

Microsoft MAPS / Windows Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service is the online community that helps you choose how to respond to potential threats. The community also helps stop the spread of new malicious software infections. You can choose to send basic or additional information about detected software. Additional information helps Microsoft create new definitions and help it to protect your computer. Possible options are: - (0x0) Disabled (default) - (0x1) Basic membership - (0x2) Advanced membership   Basic membership will send basic information to Microsoft about software that has been detected including where the software came from the actions that you apply or that are applied automatically and whether the actions were successful. Advanced membership in addition to basic information will send more information to Microsoft about malicious software spyware and potentially unwanted software including the location of the software file names how the software operates and how it has impacted your computer. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled."
    rationale: "The information that would be sent can include things like location of detected items on your computer if harmful software was removed. The information would be automatically collected and sent. In some instances personal information might unintentionally be sent to Microsoft.

For privacy reasons in high security environments, it is best to prevent these data submissions altogether."
