    title: "Disable IPv6 (Ensure TCPIP6 Parameter 'DisabledComponents' is set to '0xff (255)')"
    description: "Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a set of protocols that computers use to exchange information over the Internet and over home and business networks. IPv6 allows for many more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did. Older networking, hosts and operating systems may not support IPv6 natively. The recommended state for this setting is: DisabledComponents - 0xff (255)"
    rationale: "Since the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize IPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6 components reduces a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic on. As a result, we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not needed."
    remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to 0xff (255) (DWORD): HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\TCPIP6\\Parameters:DisabledComponents. Note: This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted. Note #2: Although Microsoft does not provide an ADMX template to configure this registry value, a custom .ADM template (Disable-IPv6-Components-KB929852.adm) is provided in the CIS Benchmark Remediation Kit to facilitate its configuration. Be aware though that simply turning off the group policy setting in the .ADM template will not \"undo\" the change once applied.
